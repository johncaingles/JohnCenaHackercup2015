#Train Tracker

This web application will allow every citizen to see the current status of the LRT and MRT trains, helping them to plan ahead their commute for the day.
The application will allow officials from the train stations to upload various data regarding the trains and platform information like the current load of people on the certain station, which will then be contributed as open data. The application then uses these data to interpret various information like the the peak hours of the train usage, which are also used for informing the citizens of the current train and platform statuses.
